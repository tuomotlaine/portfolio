# My Typewriter Portfolio

Big bow to Stephen Grider, whose react courses I have been taking at Udemy to get to know React, Redux and React-Native better.

Also this design was influenced by on of my childhood's favorite games: "Where on earth is Carmen Sandiego".

Contact me if you are interested in getting to work with me, or to have a cup of coffee.
